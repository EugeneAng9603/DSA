## 2. Explain how the `select` statement works in Go. When would you use it?

**Explanation:**  
The `select` statement allows a goroutine to wait on **multiple channel operations**. It works similarly to a `switch` statement, but for channels. 
`select` blocks until **one of the channels is ready**. If multiple channels are ready, it selects one at random. This makes it useful for handling **concurrent operations**.

### ðŸ’¡ Use Case Question: How would you use `select` for implementing a timeout or a cancellation mechanism?

**Example Question:**  
> *"You need to implement a system that processes jobs concurrently, but with a timeout mechanism. Write a Go function using `select` that processes a job and cancels if it takes longer than a given timeout."*

### âœ… Answer

You can use `select` in combination with `time.After()` to implement a **timeout mechanism**. This allows your program to cancel a blocking operation after a specified time.

#### ðŸ”§ Example: Rate limit with timeout

```go
select {
case <-rateLimitChannel:
    // Allow request
case <-time.After(time.Second * 1):
    // Handle timeout or rate limit exceeded
}
```

You can use `select` to listen to multiple channels and implement a timeout or cancellation mechanism using `time.After()`.

#### ðŸ”§ Example: Rate limit with timeout

```go
select {
case msg := <-ch1:
    // Process message from ch1
case msg := <-ch2:
    // Process message from ch2
case <-time.After(time.Second * 5):
    fmt.Println("Timeout occurred!")
}
```
