# ‚òï Java vs üêπ Go Cheat Sheet

## ‚úÖ Comparison Table
| Feature | Java | Go (Golang) |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Paradigm | OOP-centric | Procedural, composition over inheritance |
| Typing | Static | Static |
| Memory Management | Garbage Collected | Garbage Collected |
| Concurrency | Threads, ExecutorService | Goroutines, channels |
| Compilation | JVM Bytecode | Native binary |
| Syntax Verbosity | Verbose | Concise |
| Error Handling | Exceptions | Multiple return values (if err != nil) |
| Inheritance | Single inheritance + interfaces | No inheritance; interfaces + composition |
| Tooling | Maven/Gradle, JUnit | `go build`, `go test`, `go fmt` |
| Binary Size | Requires JVM | Compiled to single static binary |
| Performance | Slower startup due to JVM warmup | Faster startup; close to C performance |
| Package Management | Maven/Gradle | Go Modules |
| Standard Library | Huge and extensive | Lean but powerful |
| Use in Microservices | Common (e.g., Spring Boot) | Increasingly popular |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Easier |
| UI Development | Strong (JavaFX, Swing, Android) | Weak (not designed for UI) |
| Cross-Platform | JVM-based (write once, run anywhere) | Native binaries per OS/Arch |

## ü§Ø Common Questions & Confusions
- **Java:** Why so much boilerplate? ‚Üí Verbosity from OOP and design patterns.
- **Go:** Why no exceptions? ‚Üí Simpler, explicit error handling via return values.
- **Java:** JVM slow? ‚Üí Slow startup, but fast after warm-up due to JIT.
- **Go:** Why no generics? ‚Üí Added in Go 1.18 for more flexibility.
- **Java:** Interface vs Abstract class? ‚Üí Interface is contract-only, Abstract class has state.
- **Go:** Structural typing? ‚Üí Interfaces are implemented implicitly.
- **Java:** Why so much dependency injection? ‚Üí Object graph wiring.
- **Go:** No classes? ‚Üí Uses structs and interfaces (composition over inheritance).
