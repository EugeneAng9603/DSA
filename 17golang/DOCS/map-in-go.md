# Go `map` Implementation and Thread Safety

## Overview

In Go, a `map` is a built-in data structure that implements a hash table. It allows for the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs with average-case constant time complexity for inserts, deletes, and lookups.

## Internal Implementation

Under the hood, Go's `map` is implemented as a **hash table with open addressing and multiple buckets**. Some characteristics include:

- **Buckets**: Each map consists of an array of buckets. Each bucket holds multiple key-value pairs.
- **Hashing**: Keys are hashed to determine the appropriate bucket.
- **Load Factor and Growth**: As the number of entries grows, the map may rehash and expand to maintain performance.

The Go runtime (`runtime/map.go`) handles the low-level implementation of maps, including collision resolution and resizing.

## Thread Safety

**Go maps are *not* thread-safe.**

This means that if one goroutine is writing to a map while another is reading or writing to it concurrently, it can cause a **runtime panic** or lead to **data races**.

## Handling Concurrency

To use maps safely in concurrent applications, you can:

### 1. **Use `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex`**

Wrap your map with a mutex to control access:

```go
type SafeMap struct {
    mu sync.RWMutex
    m  map[string]int
}

func (s *SafeMap) Get(key string) (int, bool) {
    s.mu.RLock()
    defer s.mu.RUnlock()
    val, ok := s.m[key]
    return val, ok
}

func (s *SafeMap) Set(key string, value int) {
    s.mu.Lock()
    defer s.mu.Unlock()
    s.m[key] = value
}
```

### 2. **Use  `sync.Map`**
Go provides sync.Map in the sync package for concurrent access without explicit locking:

```go
var sm sync.Map

sm.Store("foo", 42)
value, ok := sm.Load("foo")

```

**Pros:**
- No need to manage locks.
- Efficient for certain workloads, especially when reads are frequent and writes are infrequent.

**Cons:**
- API is less ergonomic than native maps.
- Not as performant for all use cases.

***Conclusion***
While Go's native map is powerful and efficient, it's not thread-safe. For concurrent scenarios, use a mutex or sync.Map to ensure safe access and avoid race conditions or panics.
